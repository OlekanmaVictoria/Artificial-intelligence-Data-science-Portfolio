Much of the EEG is relatively low voltage and featureless aside from a higher amplitude, broadly contoured periodic complex in the left posterior quadrant with a generous field of spread including T5, T1, T3.  The right hemisphere is lower voltage and does pick up some of the activity from the left, perhaps due to a transverse dipole.

This is an awake and drowsy record in a cooperative patient.\\nMEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Vimpat.\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The right hemisphere includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates some underlying focal slowing in the left posterior temporal region with a breach rhythm, accentuation of amplitude in that region, some underlying delta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.\\nIn the context of a breach rhythm, there is an underlying, P3/T5 sharp waves, primarily noted at P3.\\nPhotic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation produces some bilateral slowing.  Frontally predominant rhythmic theta was noted in hyperventilation.\\nHeart rate 78 bpm.\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:\\nBackground slowing noted from both hemispheres, the left more so than the right.\\nSubtle underlying delta noted in the left hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant.\\nBreach rhythm.\\nSubtle underlying left parietal sharp waves in the context of a breech rhythm.\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual with a structural lesion and previous status epilepticus, this EEG is improved compared to other studies.  The patient is clearly awake with a well-formed alpha rhythm on the right, although it is a bit slow.  The focal features described above are compatible with the patient's known structural abnormality.  No seizures were recorded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n",

Using it outside of your model enables you to do asynchronous CPU processing and buffering of your data when training on GPU. So, if you're training your model on the GPU, you probably want to go with this option to get the best performance while developing your model, then switch to including the `TextVectorization` layer inside your model when you're ready to prepare for deployment.\n",

There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  The stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.\n",
